Test Driven Development Workflow
===============================

https://github.com/cloudacademy/java-tdd-bitcoinconverter  - A sperate branch is given for each of the demonstrations

Uses JDK11 and JUnit5

Test Drive Devlopmemnt (TDD) is an agile software development principle
Focused on unit tests
	Write Test -> Run Test (fail) -> Wrote Code -> Run Test (pass) -> CleanUp (Refactor) ----> Repeat (Small iterations)
	
	
TDD - Red, Green Refactor
	Red 	- Write Test, watch it fail
	Green 	- Write just enough code to pass the test
	Refactor - Improve code without modifying its behaviour
	
Clean Code - A handbook of agile software craftmanship.  Robert C Martin (Uncle Bob)
3 rules of TDD
	1. You must write a failing test before you write any production code
	2. You must not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail, or fail to compile
	3. You must not write more production code than is sufficient to make the currently failing test pass.
Unit test introduced early, frequently and executed often	

CI/CD - Continuous integration, continuous deploy
	Unit tests, inte tests and E2E tests
	
Best Pactices
	Individual tests should be small and focused
	Test and asset for expected results
	Test abd assert for edge cases and known error conditions
	Execute tests regularly and often
	Avoid creating tests which have external dependencies whose state is unknown and uncontrollable.

Junit - Triple "A" pattern - Arrange, act, assert
Unit test naming strategy - methodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehaviour
